# AirBnB-New-York-City

Introduction
Airbnb is famously known as an online American company for vacation rentals and tourism activities, where
people rent out their property to welcome travellers to make them feel at home, a place that is readily available,
economical, and accessible. Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and
more tourists choose this marketplace over others as their primary accommodation provider.


Problem Definition
Since its beginning in 2008, Airbnb has seen enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website
and is growing exponentially since. We know that one of the most popular cities to visit in the United States is
New York City. Itâ€™s widely known for the richness of its five boroughs namely, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens,
Bronx, and Staten Island. Our dataset contains information about the availability of an Airbnb in a particular
Area with other information. Through this project, we attempt to analyze the trends to understand customer
preferences for selecting an Airbnb over other hotels for long-term stay, on the basis of pricing, location,
availability, reviews, and hosting services.
